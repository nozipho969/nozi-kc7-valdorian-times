My hands on SOC analyst experience on completing the Valdorian Times Scandal scenario on KC7
# KC7 - The Valdorian Times Scandal 🗞️

Hi there! 👋

I recently completed the **Valdorian Times Scandal** scenario on KC7, an incredible gamified platform for practicing real-world cybersecurity investigations.

## What I Learned

- How phishing emails can lead to real-world consequences
- How attackers use malicious PowerShell scripts and tunnels (like Plink) to gain access
- How data exfiltration works in practice
- The importance of verifying documents and email sources before taking action

## Why KC7?

KC7 has been a safe and engaging way for me to build my SOC analyst skills hands-on. If you’re studying cybersecurity or dreaming of a career in the SOC, I highly recommend checking it out!

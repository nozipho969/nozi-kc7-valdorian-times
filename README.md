Hi there! 👋  

I’m Nozipho, currently diving deeper into cybersecurity and blue team skills. I just completed **The Valdorian Times Scandal** on [KC7](https://kc7cyber.com), and it was one of the most thrilling learning experiences I’ve had so far!

## 📰 What Happened

- Attackers sent phishing emails to The Valdorian Times staff.
- One click led to malware dropping a malicious PowerShell script.
- Hackers created a tunnel into the network using Plink.
- They replaced an Op-Ed article with fake news to influence a mayoral election.
- They exfiltrated sensitive documents…and even “dank memes.” 😆

## 💡 What I Learned

✅ How phishing attacks lead to real consequences.  
✅ How malicious scripts like PowerShell can be deployed undetected.  
✅ How attackers use tunnels to maintain hidden access.  
✅ How important it is to verify every document or email source.  
✅ That cyber incidents can be chaotic but solving them is *extremely* satisfying!
